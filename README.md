# EcoFootprint
A carbon footprint tracker. Final project for ES101, GEd106, and CS222.

EcoFotprint is cathered for Batangas State University Alangilan Campus. The application is created using C# and Windows Form.

Organizations all around the world are moving to lower their carbon footprints as a result of the growing awareness of the need to address climate change. With a campus that spans acres and houses a variety of buildings, laboratories, and equipment, Batangas State University must properly assess and control its carbon emissions. With the help of EcoFootprint, Batangas State University will have a strong platform for tracking, evaluating, and lowering its carbon footprint. The tracker will provide information on energy usage, transportation, and other pertinent aspects of the campus, thereby providing an environmental impact assessment. With the use of the data presented by EcoFootprint, Batangas State University will be able to pinpoint areas in need of development, establish goals for reducing emissions, and integrate sustainable practices into all aspects of its operations.  

As the developers behind EcoFootprint, the carbon footprint tracker for the Alangilan campus of Batangas State University, our team understands the vital role this project plays in encouraging environmental responsibility and sustainability among campus residents. Batangas State University—The National Engineering University—is dedicated to promoting quality and innovation in engineering education and research. With EcoFootprint, we hope to give Batangas State University an efficient tool for tracking and controlling its carbon emissions.
